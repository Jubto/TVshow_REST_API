TVshow REST API university project which I received 15/15 for. 
- This API service aims to allow users to store TV shows and retrevie useful statistics on them.
- This API communicates with the API www.tvmaze.com/api to retreive TV show data, and stores them locally in a SQLite database.
- This API was made with flask_restx, meaning a swagger doc has been auto-generated for ease of use.
- Run the server in terminal and use any browser client to communicate with the API (hosted locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
